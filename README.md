Repository for work on the 2015 SciVis contest held by IEEE (http://sciviscontest.ieeevis.org/)

1) Where is the data for this project?
    You should download the data from
    https://cloud.sdsc.edu/v1/AUTH_sciviscontest/2015/ds14_scivis_0128/ and put
    it in the directory "./data". That is where all the examples will assume it
    is located.
